# Code_Examples
A collection of a few personal projects and school assignments to showcase my programming abilities. The subject of all of these project has been to learn either a concept or a language or both, so performance and or results have not been the primary goal. 


## Snake AI (Personal Project)
Written in Processing which is a high-level language built on-top of Java. It tries to teach a neural network to play snake, as inputs are a set of whiskers that can detect its own body, an edge or food. Five snakes are initialized at the same time although they are not in the same "world", hence they don't compete for food or can see eachother. The network weigths that outputs a turning angle is then optimized using genetic algorithm. It takes quite a long time to converge and with rendering the graphics in real time it takes way to long time to converge to a "playable snake". Inside the folder there are application flders of various OS'es to try it out.

## Stock Data (Personal Project)
Witten in Python notebooks. I set up this project to implement topics of deep learning as I was learning them, for instance convolutional neural networks or recurrent nerual networks. It is pretty common knowledge that historical stock prices contain little predictive power, so I don't expect to be able to pull it off, but why not try to learn on something that might make me rich on the off-change I discover something :) 

## Flock (Personal Project)
Written in Javascript. Implemented the Boid model using the p5 library. This was just as I started to learn programming and offers a fun way to learn OO-programming etc. Just open index.html in a browser to see the program. 

## Collaborative Filtering (Personal Project)
Written in Python notebooks.A implementation of collaborative filtering (movie recommendations) I wrote as I was reading the book "Collective Intelligence" to solidify the contect. 

## Store Sales Prediction (Personal Project)
Written in Python notebooks. A Kaggle competition I entered quite recently where the goal is to predict the sales of a set of items from different stores. It is a work in progress but I have some interesting ideas I would like to implement. Great way to learn about time series prediction as there are a ton of available information on Kaggle from some very smart people. 

## Stochastic Optimization (School Project)
Written in Matlab. Part of a course with the same name, using evolutionary algorithms to optimize problems. In the files are solution folders to the tasks as well as reports. Unfortunately I do not have access to the problem descriptions. 

## Neural Network (School Project)
Written in Matlab. Also a school project implementing nerual networks from scratch in Matlab.
